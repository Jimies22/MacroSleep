/**
 * # Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-related data,
 * including profiles, sleep logs, and macro logs, is isolated within a
 * user-specific data tree. The core principle is that a user can only access
 * their own information. There is no concept of public or shared data in this model.
 *
 * # Data Structure
 * All data is organized hierarchically under the top-level `/users` collection.
 * Each user's data is stored in a document structure like `/users/{userId}/...`,
 * where `{userId}` corresponds to the user's Firebase Authentication UID.
 * Specific data types are segregated into their own subcollections:
 * - `/users/{userId}/profile/{profileId}`: Contains the user's profile document.
 * - `/users/{userId}/sleep_logs/{sleepLogId}`: A collection of the user's sleep entries.
 * - `/users/{userId}/macro_logs/{macroLogId}`: A collection of the user's macro entries.
 *
 * # Key Security Decisions
 * - **Strict Ownership**: All rules are based on the `{userId}` path parameter,
 *   ensuring that `request.auth.uid` must match `{userId}` for any access to be granted.
 * - **No Public Access**: All read and write operations require a user to be
 *   authenticated. No data is exposed to unauthenticated users.
 * - **User Privacy**: Listing documents in the top-level `/users` collection is
 *   explicitly forbidden to prevent enumeration of all users in the application.
 * - **Relational Integrity**: On creation, rules validate that the document data
 *   contains an internal ownership field (`id` or `userId`) that matches the
 *   `{userId}` from the path. This field is enforced as immutable on updates to
 *   prevent documents from being "re-assigned" to different users.
 *
 * # Denormalization for Authorization
 * This security model primarily relies on path-based ownership, which is highly
 * performant and secure. The `SleepLog` and `MacroLog` documents contain a
 * denormalized `userId` field. The rules leverage this field to enforce a
 * consistent and immutable link between a log entry and its owner, ensuring
 * that the relationship established at creation can never be broken.
 *
 * # Structural Segregation
 * The data model is already structurally segregated by user, which is a highly
 * secure pattern. Each user's data exists in its own isolated path, making it
 * impossible for one user's queries to accidentally leak data from another user.
